# mentalhealth-site

Web app devloped with Django where users can track there mental health through journal entries and daily check-ins. Journal entries are analyzed with a sentiment analysis model to detect depression or suicdal thoughts. 

The website was deployed using Heroku, and can be accessed here: https://mentalhealth-site.herokuapp.com/
(NOTE: Since I am using a free tier and the site has to load a machine learning model, first starting the app can take up to a minute. However, after that the site should run fine)
