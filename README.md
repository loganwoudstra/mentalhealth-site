# Mental Health Natural Languag Processing Model Website
Suicdal or depressive thoughts are detected in journal entries using sentiment analysis. A natural Langage Proccessing(NLP) model analyzes jounral entries entered onto the website, and users showing signs of poor mental health are directed to resources to help them imporve their well-being. 

The Colab Notebook where I devloped the model can be accesed here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/117JIc-V6DViaTNyyO-PcD4zLAVBAXe3q?usp=sharing

The website was devloped with Django and deployed using Heroku, and can be accessed here: https://mentalhealth-site.herokuapp.com/

(NOTE: Since I am using a free tier and the site has to load a machine learning model, first starting the app can take up to a minute. However, after that the site should run fine)
